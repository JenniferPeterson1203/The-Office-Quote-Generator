# The Office Quote Generator

This is a web application that generates random quotes from the TV show "The Office".

# Instructions:

Clone the "The-Office-Quote-Generator" repository to your local machine using the Git clone command in your terminal or by downloading the ZIP file from the repository's main page.

Once you have the project files on your local machine, navigate to the root directory of the project using your terminal or file explorer.

Open the index1.html file in your browser by entering Open index1.html in your terminal.

Enter a character name in the input field and click the "Generate Quote" button.

A random quote by that character will be displayed below the button.

If you want to generate another quote, you can click the "Generate Quote" button again or enter a different character's name.

# Notes:

The character name is case-insensitive, so you can enter it in any case.
If you enter an invalid character name, you will receive an alert.
If you leave the input field empty and click the "Generate Quote" button, you will receive an alert to enter a character name.
The web application uses the Office API to fetch quotes from the show.
