            <p>
              Hello! My name is <strong>Jennifer Peterson</strong>. I am a
              current fellow at Pursuit. I am looking forward to utilizing the
              education and tools that Pursuit offers in order to get my foot in
              the door and prosper. I have 9 years of customer service
              experience where I was able to develop great communication,
              problem solving, and teamwork skills, which I believe would help
              me as a software engineer when I complete my fellowship at the end
              of the year. As a parent of a young girl who has expressed an
              interest in becoming an engineer in the future, I want to
              influence her to not be discouraged when it comes to pursuing a
              career in a male dominated field.
            </p>
